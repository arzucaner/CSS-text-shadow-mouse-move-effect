# CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect

---

## The CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect project is a challenge project created by Wes Bos. The project involves creating a unique text-shadow effect that changes based on the position of the user's mouse.

The project requires a strong understanding of CSS properties such as text-shadow, transform, and transition, as well as knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to detect mouse position and update the CSS accordingly.

The end result of the project is a visually impressive effect where the text appears to have a subtle 3D effect that reacts to the user's mouse movement. The challenge also encourages developers to experiment with different color schemes and animation styles to make the effect their own.

Overall, the CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect project is a great exercise in CSS and JavaScript skills, and a fun way to create a unique and visually appealing effect for web pages.
